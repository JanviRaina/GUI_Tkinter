WHAT POLLUTION-FREE BEAUTY IS ALL ABOUT
Almost every skincare brand today has an anti-pollution
line to its name. While Ren offers the Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist, Innisfree
has a City Pollution Defender bubble foam, and Clinique a City Block Purifying Charcoal Clay
 Mask & Scrub. Other anti-pollution products include Keihl’s Pollutant Defending Masque, and Clarins’
 UV Plus Antipollution Day Screen Multi-Protection cream. Ingredients in anti-pollution
products range from Vit C and E extracts, to hyaluronic acid and
 antioxidants, to charcoal, green tea and matcha.
